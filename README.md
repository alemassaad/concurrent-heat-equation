# Heat Equation Solver in CUDA
## Overview
This project implements a solver for the heat equation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation) on a 2D plane using CUDA, i.e., efficient parallel processing on GPUs. 
##Project Structure
/src: Contains all the C source code for the sequential and CUDA implementations. 
/bin: This directory will contain the compiled executables. 
/data: Any output files or intermediate data used by the solver.
